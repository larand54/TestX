Test a grails problem

This project contains a page (product) that maintain a couple of lists, one for products and one for offers.
Each product line also contain a supplier for this product. Using a select you can filter out products from a specific supplier.

The offer list is only visible if the user click on a products volume field if there is an offer connected to this product.
This works well as long as the select has not been used. If that has been used then you can not update the offerlist any more. So with this test project I hope that someone can help me solve this problem.
